# Lists
## An app that creates a new list for you at whatever URL you please.

User Stories:
Allows a user to specify a url, (http://lists.haus.world/gen/**mylistname**), and the list will be created at this URL.
When the adds a new item, the item is added to a document in MongoDB. So when the URL is visited again after closing the page, the list will still be there.
